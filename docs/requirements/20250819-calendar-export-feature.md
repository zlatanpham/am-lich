# Calendar Export Feature - Requirements Document

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: August 19, 2025  
**Project**: Âm Lịch (Vietnamese Lunar Calendar) - Calendar Export Feature  
**Status**: New Feature Requirement  
**Target Users**: Vietnamese users who want to integrate lunar calendar events with external calendar systems

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a calendar export feature that allows users to export their Vietnamese lunar calendar events and data in standard calendar formats (iCalendar/ICS) for import into popular calendar platforms like Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, and other calendar applications. The feature will support selective export of lunar events, user personal events, or combined data sets with proper Vietnamese cultural context preservation.

## Business Context and Problem Statement

### Problem Statement

Users of the Vietnamese lunar calendar application need a way to synchronize their traditional lunar calendar events with their modern digital calendars. Currently, users must manually recreate important Vietnamese lunar dates (Mồng 1, Rằm, traditional holidays, ancestor worship dates) in their external calendar systems, leading to:

1. **Data Duplication**: Users manually recreate events across multiple calendar systems
2. **Missed Important Dates**: Risk of forgetting to transfer important Vietnamese cultural events
3. **Cultural Context Loss**: External calendars lack Vietnamese cultural significance and proper terminology
4. **Maintenance Burden**: Users must manually update recurring lunar events each year
5. **Integration Gap**: No seamless workflow between Vietnamese lunar calendar awareness and daily planning tools

### Business Objectives

- Enable seamless integration between Vietnamese lunar calendar events and mainstream calendar platforms
- Preserve Vietnamese cultural context and terminology in exported calendar data
- Reduce manual effort for users who want to sync lunar events with their primary calendars
- Increase user engagement by making the Vietnamese lunar calendar more accessible in daily workflows
- Support different user preferences for what types of events to export (lunar-only, personal-only, or combined)
- Maintain data accuracy and proper recurring event handling for lunar calendar cycles

## Stakeholder Analysis

### Primary Stakeholders

- **End Users**: Vietnamese users who maintain both traditional lunar calendar awareness and modern digital calendars
- **Calendar Integration Users**: Users who rely on Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook, or other calendar platforms for daily scheduling
